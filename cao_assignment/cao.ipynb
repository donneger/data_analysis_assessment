    "### Introduction\n",
    "This assignment is about getting data from websites and being able to analyse that data, all through Python. The specific use case in this instance is the points data contained on the CAO website. The objective of the assignment is to be able to automatically extract the relevant points data for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 and complete an analysis of that data, comparing each of the years and assessing what are the key trends that emerge from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CAO or Central Applications Office is the body that processes all applications for third level educational institutions that are part of the Irish Higher Education system (HEI's). Students sit the Leaving Certificate exam, i.e. the final assessment of second level education and on the basis of results in each subject taken are awarded points. The sum total of points achieved are used by the HEI's to make course offers to students on the basis of their overall points tally and their prior stated course preferences. All of the third level course offers to students are then made thorugh the CAO.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAO was instituted in 1977 and it is interesting to note that from a starting point of just 5 HEI's in 1977 and just under 15 thousand applicants it has grown steadily since then to reach 37 HEI's and in excess of 80 thousand applicants in 2021. The number of courses offered has gone from 69 in 1977 to over 1000 in 2021. [CAO Media Stats](http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=mediapack&bb=mediastats)\n",
    "\n",
    "While not considered in this assignment the growth, changes in the scale and course profiles offered by the CAO since its inception in 1977 provides an interesting insight into wider societal changes. Over this period Ireland has transformed itself from a largely rural and small scale industrial profile to one where some of the giants of 21st century global industry are happy to operate here. For example, one can only marvel at the scale of the site currently under construction at Intel in Leixlip, a scene unrecognisable to the leaving cert cohort of 1977 but entirely in keeping with the skillsets emerging from our 21st century education system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a narrower, but no less interesting time scale, i.e. 2019 - 2021, it will be interesting to see how the impact of a global pandemic and the complete upheaval of the education system during this period may be reflected in the CAO points trends over the three years. Apart from the mechanics of getting at the data, this will be the primary outcome of this assignment. "

    "### Assignment Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will be tackled in the following stages:\n",
    "- Accessing and extracting the 2019 - 2021 points data from the CAO Website\n",
    "- Creating a single pandas dataframe to hold all of the data.\n",
    "- Use of the pandas dataframe to analyse the points data across the 3 years. \n",
    "- Use of plots to demonstrate the essential elements of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of assignment scope in relation to the data following should be noted:\n",
    "- The analysis will be confined to the points data for first round offers for **Level 8** courses only. While it is recognised that Levels 6 and 7 courses play an important role in higher education the clearest indicators of pandemic impacts are at the Level 8 courses. \n",
    "- To provide meaningful year on year comparisons the analysis will also be restricted to those courses that appear in all three years, the logic being this is the best way to see the year on year trends. I will use 2019 as the base year. \n"

    "### Section 1 - Getting the Data. \n",
    "All the CAO points data is contained on the CAO website with links for each year going back to 1998. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Observations on the points Data\n",
    "- For some reason the CAO do not appear to maintain a consistent approach to providing the annual points data. This provides some interesting challenges to get the data.\n",
    "- Points 2019. The data is contained in a PDF document which requires additional steps to convert to a form useable in a pandas dataframe. \n",
    "- Points 2020. The data is contained in a Excel .xlsx format which can be used directly to import to a dataframe.  \n",
    "- Points 2021. The data is now contained in an Excel .xlsx file, previously it was contained only in a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are some common characteristics to the data common across all years that will form an important part of the extraction, transformations and analysis:\n",
    "- Every Level 8 course is assigned a 5 character code, example *DC120 - Computing for Business.*\n",
    "    - The first 2 characters are alphabetic and indicate the college, in the above example DC refers to Dublin City University.\n",
    "    - The three digits indicate the course.\n",
    "- In general the datasets contain course codes, course names, college names and points for each course, being initial offers and subsequect offer rounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition all courses are alos assigned to an ISCED classification. [Link to ISCED Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Education). This classification system, designed in the early 1970's and substantially updated in 1997 and 2011 serves to provide a standard international classification system across all educational levels in all counrties. It allows for course and course level comparibility within countries and internationally. The ISCED 2011 has been adopted across the EU since 2014 and the revised classification of fields of education and training ISCED-F-2013 has been implemented on education systems data collection since 2014/2015. [Link to ISCED Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=International_Standard_Classification_of_Education_(ISCED)#Implementation_of_ISCED_2011_.28levels_of_education.29).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in ISCED-F 2013 **06** defines the field of Information and Communication Technologies and in the CAO system 061 defines courses allocated to the general subject area of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). \n",
    "\n",
    "So for a full course classifications example CK411 is a Level 8 course in Data Science and Analytics course offered by University College Cork and is assigned to (061) Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for general classification. These classifications will be useful in looking at trends in general areas as against specific courses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point to note is that the points data also inlcudes additional characters that have to be dealt with, usually appended before or after the numeric digits. It also inlcudes non numeric data.\n",
    "- The # character signifies that entry to the associated course is also dependant on an additional Test, Interview, Portfolio or Audition, e.g. #700 or #+matric.\n",
    "- AQA indicates that the course had sufficient places to offer to all qualified applicants so no points data is provided. \n",
    "- The * character indicates that not all applicants achieveing the points score were offered places, final selection usually by lottery. \n",
    "- n/a characters, likely to indicate that there were no applicants or the course was not offered. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of the assignment I will start with the 2021 data and work backwards. Overall my objective is to get each of the years data and combine all to one data frame. The basic structure of this final dataset will be course code, course name, course category, college name, points, year. "
