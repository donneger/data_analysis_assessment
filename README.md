# Fundamentals of Data Analysis
## Project Repository - Gerry Donnelly

### Introduction
This repository holds the two projects required for submission for this course. The projects are as follows:
- An Exploration of Pyplot. This project is contained in the folder **pyplot_assignment**.
- Analysis of CAO Points 2019 - 2021. This project is contained in the folder **cao_assignment**

### Project 1. Exploration of the matplotlib.pyplot Package. 
#### Project Summary
The folder **pyplot_assignment** holds the jupyter notebook **pyplot.ipynb** which contains all of the project text and related python code. 

It is an introduction and exploration of the matplotlib.pyplot package. The project describes the key elements of the package and how it can be used in many data analytics use cases to provide essential visualisation of data. These visualisations can take many forms, from simple to complex charts and graphs to image manipulation and image recognition in machine learning. 

The project introduces the key concepts for creating chart outputs for datasets and describes a number of different chart types e..g line charts, bar charts, box plots. It is however intended as an introduction, the full range of pyplot capabilities are outside the scope of this project. Further details on the package can be viewed in the matplotlib tutorials at https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html.


#### Running the Project
1. Python, as well as the python packages matplotlib, numpy, numpy random and pandas should be available on the local machine, if not it is recommended to install Ananconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual which contains the majority of commonly used python packages. 
2. The project can be downloaded from the repository, both the pyplot.ipynb and phototest.jpg should be located in the same folder. 
3. Open a Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab session and run the pyplot notebook, the code will run from start to finish without any user interaction needed. 
4. The various plots can be viewed in the notebook and a sample plots image is also output to the local folder. 
5. If necessary Jupyter can be installed from https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html. 

### Project 2. CAO Points 2019 - 2021. 
#### Project Summary
The folder cao_assignment holds all of the code and data for running this project. It contains
- cao.ipyng. This is the Jupyter notebook holding all of the project text and code. 
- CAO_Data folder. This holds datasets used by the program as well as those output by the program. 

This project is an analysis of the trends of CAO points needed to enter Irish Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) between 2019 and 2021. This is a particularly interesting period due to the impact of Covid on the methodology of awarding subject level points at Leaving Certificate level. Due to Covid the process has moved from being a fully examination based process to that of a largely non-exam based assesment of students. What has become apparent is that this radical and sudden imposed change on the process has had a significant growth impact on the profile of points awarded and the subsequent increases in points requirements for college entry. 

The project takes the points data from each of the three years to create a consolidated points file that is then used to look at the trends. 

#### Running the Project
1. As per Project 1 it is recommended to install Anaconda if not already installed on the local machine. 
2. The project can be downloaded from the repository, both the cao.ipynb notebook and the CAO_Data folder should be located in the same folder. 
3. Open a Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab session and run the cao.ipynb notebook, the code will run from start to finish without any user interaction needed. See above in Project 1 the link for instruction on installing Jupyter if needed. 
4. The various plots can be viewed in the notebook and a the resulting datasets are output to the CAO_Data folder.
